## Publish Skills

### Self-Host on Your Domain (Recommended)

Generate a well-known URI structure (RFC 8615) to host skills on your own domain:

```bash
# Create and validate your skill
skillkit create my-skill
skillkit validate my-skill

# Generate hosting structure
skillkit publish ./my-skill --output ./public
```

This creates:
```
.well-known/skills/
  index.json              # Skill manifest for auto-discovery
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md              # Your skill content
```

Deploy the `.well-known` folder to your web server. Users can then install via:

```bash
skillkit add https://your-domain.com
```

### Submit to SkillKit Marketplace

To submit your skill for inclusion in the central marketplace:

```bash
skillkit publish submit
```

This opens a GitHub issue for review by maintainers.
