# Skills

A skill is an instruction file that teaches AI coding agents how to handle specific tasks. Each skill uses a universal Markdown format (SKILL.md) with YAML frontmatter.

## Skills vs Context vs Commands

| Type | Purpose | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Skills** | Task-specific reusable instructions | SKILL.md |
| **Context** | Project-wide environment info | JSON/YAML |
| **Commands** | Quick-action slash commands | Various |

## Skill Format

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
license: MIT
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0"
  tags:
    - react
    - typescript

# My Skill

Instructions for the AI agent.

## When to Use

- Scenario 1
- Scenario 2

## Steps

1. First step
2. Second step
```

## Skill Lifecycle

Skills progress through six stages:

1. **Discovery** - `findAllSkills()` scans directories for SKILL.md files
2. **Quality Evaluation** - `evaluateSkillContent()` produces 0-100 scores (grades A-F)
3. **Parsing** - `parseSkillFile()` extracts YAML frontmatter and markdown content
4. **Translation** - `translateSkill()` converts to agent-specific formats
5. **Installation** - Skills deployed to agent directories with metadata tracking
6. **Testing** - Test suites with 14+ assertion types validate skills

## Quality Evaluation

Skills receive scores across four weighted dimensions:

- **Structure** - 25 points: Frontmatter completeness, markdown sections
- **Clarity** - 30 points: Description quality, instruction precision
- **Specificity** - 30 points: Concrete examples, actionable steps
- **Advanced** - 15 points: Test coverage, version info, examples

**Grades:**
- A: 90 to 100
- B: 80 to 89
- C: 70 to 79
- D: 60 to 69
- F: below 60

## Skill Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **GitHub/GitLab** | Remote repository collections |
| **Local filesystem** | Project-specific skills |
| **Marketplace** | 15,000+ curated skills with search |

## Creating Skills

```bash
skillkit create my-skill
```

Or manually create a `SKILL.md` file following the format above.

## Publishing Skills

```bash
# Test locally
skillkit validate ./my-skill

# Publish to marketplace
skillkit publish
```
