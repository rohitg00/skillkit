# SkillKit

Skills make AI coding agents smarter. But every agent uses a different format — Claude Code wants `.claude/skills/`, Cursor uses `.mdc`, Copilot expects `.github/skills/`. You end up rewriting the same skill three times, or locking into one platform.

SkillKit fixes this. Write a skill once, deploy it to all 32 agents.

## Get Started

```bash
npx skillkit@latest
```

That's it. No global install needed. Or if you prefer:

```bash
npm install -g skillkit
skillkit init
skillkit install anthropics/skills
skillkit sync
```

Four commands. Your agents now have skills for PDF processing, code review, and more.

## What Can You Do?

### Install skills from anywhere

```bash
skillkit install anthropics/skills          # GitHub
skillkit install gitlab:team/skills         # GitLab
skillkit install ./my-local-skills          # Local
```

### Translate between agents

Write for Claude, deploy to Cursor:

```bash
skillkit translate my-skill --to cursor
skillkit translate --all --to windsurf      # All skills at once
```

### Get smart recommendations

SkillKit reads your `package.json`, detects your stack, and suggests relevant skills:

```bash
skillkit recommend
# 92% vercel-react-best-practices
# 87% tailwind-v4-patterns
# 85% nextjs-app-router
```

### Discover skills at runtime

Start an API server and let agents find skills on demand:

```bash
skillkit serve
# Server running at http://localhost:3737
```

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3737/search?q=react+performance"
```

Or use MCP for native agent integration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "skillkit": { "command": "npx", "args": ["@skillkit/mcp"] }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

SkillKit sits between your skills and your agents. It handles format translation, discovery, and synchronization automatically.

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **CLI + TUI** | Install, translate, recommend, sync |
| **APIs** | REST server on :3737, MCP via stdio |
| **Core** | Translation engine, relevance ranker, skill parser |
| **Data** | 15,000+ skills from 31 curated sources |

## Supported Agents

32 agents and counting:

**Claude Code** | **Cursor** | **Codex** | **Gemini CLI** | **OpenCode** | **GitHub Copilot** | **Windsurf** | Amp | Antigravity | Clawdbot | Cline | CodeBuddy | CommandCode | Continue | Crush | Droid | Factory | Goose | Kilo Code | Kiro CLI | MCPJam | Mux | Neovate | OpenHands | Pi | Qoder | Qwen | Roo Code | Trae | Vercel | Zencoder | Universal

## Beyond Basic Skills

### Session Memory

Your AI agents learn patterns during sessions, then forget everything. SkillKit captures those learnings and makes them permanent.

```bash
skillkit memory compress
skillkit memory search "auth patterns"
skillkit memory export auth-patterns
```

### Primer

Auto-generate CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, and agent instructions by analyzing your codebase:

```bash
skillkit primer --all-agents
```

### Mesh Network

Distribute agents across machines with encrypted P2P:

```bash
skillkit mesh init
skillkit mesh discover
```

### Team Collaboration

Share skills via a Git-committable `.skills` manifest:

```bash
skillkit manifest init
skillkit manifest add anthropics/skills
git commit -m "add team skills"
```

Team members run `skillkit manifest install` and they're in sync.
