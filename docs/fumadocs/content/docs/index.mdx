# SkillKit

SkillKit is a universal command-line interface (CLI) and programmatic toolkit for managing AI agent skills across **32 AI coding platforms**.

**Current Version:** v1.8.0

## The Problem

Each AI coding agent uses different skill formats and directory structures:
- Claude Code uses `.claude/skills/` with SKILL.md
- Cursor uses `.cursor/skills/` with .mdc format
- GitHub Copilot uses `.github/skills/`

Without SkillKit, you either rewrite skills for each agent, lock into one platform, or abandon skills entirely.

## The Solution

SkillKit provides a **"write once, deploy everywhere"** platform. Maintain a single skill definition that automatically translates across all 32 platforms.

## Quick Install

```bash
# Run instantly with npx (no install required)
npx skillkit@latest

# Or install globally for frequent use
npm install -g skillkit
skillkit init
skillkit install anthropics/skills
skillkit sync
```

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Cross-Platform Translation** | Automatic conversion between 32 agent formats |
| **Smart Recommendations** | AI-powered skill suggestions based on your tech stack |
| **Session Memory** | Persistent learning that survives across sessions |
| **Primer** | Auto-generate agent instructions from your codebase |
| **Mesh Network** | Multi-machine agent distribution with encrypted P2P |
| **Inter-Agent Messaging** | Send messages between AI agents across your network |
| **Team Collaboration** | Git-based `.skills` manifest for sharing |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | Compose skills into multi-step automated workflows |
| **Skill Testing** | Built-in test framework with assertions |
| **CI/CD Integration** | GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and pre-commit hooks |
| **TypeScript API** | Full programmatic access to all features |
| **Interactive TUI** | Beautiful terminal interface with real-time updates |

## Advanced Capabilities

### Session Memory System

Your AI agents learn patterns during sessions—then forget everything. SkillKit captures these learnings and makes them permanent.

```bash
skillkit memory compress      # Compress learnings
skillkit memory search auth   # Search knowledge
skillkit memory export auth-patterns  # Export as skill
```

### Primer - Auto-Generate Instructions

Automatically generate CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, and agent instructions by analyzing your codebase.

```bash
skillkit primer                # Analyze project
skillkit primer --all-agents   # Generate for all 32 agents
```

### Mesh Network

Run agents across multiple machines with encrypted P2P communication.

```bash
skillkit mesh init       # Initialize mesh node
skillkit mesh discover   # Find peers on LAN
skillkit mesh security init  # Setup Ed25519 encryption
```

### Inter-Agent Messaging

Send messages between AI agents across your mesh network.

```bash
skillkit message send    # Send to another agent
skillkit message inbox   # Check your inbox
```
