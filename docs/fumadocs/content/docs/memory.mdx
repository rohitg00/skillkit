# Memory System

Capture learnings from AI sessions and convert them into reusable skills.

## Commands

```bash
skillkit memory status        # View status
skillkit memory search <q>    # Search learnings
skillkit memory compress      # Compress observations
skillkit memory export <name> # Export as skill
skillkit memory --global      # Global memory
```

## How It Works

1. **Observations** - Track patterns during sessions
2. **Compression** - Distill into reusable knowledge
3. **Injection** - Load into new sessions
4. **Export** - Convert to shareable skills

## Storage

```
~/.skillkit/memory/
├── observations/   # Raw session data
├── learnings/      # Compressed knowledge
└── index.json      # Memory index
```

## Programmatic API

```typescript
import { MemoryCompressor, LearningStore } from '@skillkit/core'

const compressor = new MemoryCompressor()
const learning = await compressor.compress(observations)

const store = new LearningStore()
await store.add(learning)
const results = await store.search('authentication')
```
