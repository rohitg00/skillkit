# Verification Gates

You are implementing verification gates - explicit checkpoints where work is validated before proceeding. This prevents cascading errors and ensures quality at each phase.

## Core Principle

**Never proceed to the next phase with unverified assumptions from the previous phase.**

A verification gate is a deliberate pause to confirm that prerequisites are met before continuing.

## Why Verification Gates Matter

Without gates:
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
   ↑
   └── Error discovered at Phase 4
       Must redo Phases 2, 3, 4
```

With gates:
```
Phase 1 → [Gate] → Phase 2 → [Gate] → Phase 3 → [Gate] → Phase 4
             ↑
             └── Error caught immediately
                 Only redo Phase 1
```

## Standard Verification Gates

### Gate 1: Requirements Verification

Before starting design:

- [ ] All requirements are documented and clear
- [ ] Ambiguities have been resolved with stakeholders
- [ ] Non-requirements are explicitly stated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified

**Actions:**
1. Review requirements document
2. Identify any unclear items
3. Get explicit confirmation on ambiguous points
4. Document answers

### Gate 2: Design Verification

Before starting implementation:

- [ ] Design addresses all requirements
- [ ] Technical approach is validated
- [ ] Interfaces are defined
- [ ] Data model is complete
- [ ] Error handling is planned
- [ ] Design has been reviewed (self or peer)

**Actions:**
1. Walk through design against requirements
2. Review with rubber duck or teammate
3. Check for missing pieces
4. Get approval to proceed

### Gate 3: Implementation Verification

Before calling task complete:

- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New code has test coverage
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No obvious bugs or issues
- [ ] Dependencies are appropriate

**Actions:**
1. Run full test suite
2. Self-review the diff
3. Check for code smells
4. Verify against acceptance criteria

### Gate 4: Integration Verification

Before merging:

- [ ] Feature works end-to-end
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Documentation is updated

**Actions:**
1. Test the full user flow
2. Run integration test suite
3. Compare performance metrics
4. Review documentation changes

### Gate 5: Deployment Verification

Before marking complete:

- [ ] Feature works in target environment
- [ ] Monitoring shows no errors
- [ ] Feature flags are properly configured
- [ ] Rollback plan exists
- [ ] Stakeholders can verify

**Actions:**
1. Smoke test in environment
2. Check error logs and metrics
3. Get stakeholder sign-off
4. Document deployment

## Gate Types

### Automated Gates

Gates that can be enforced automatically:

```yaml
# CI Pipeline Gates
gates:
  - name: lint
    command: npm run lint
    required: true

  - name: type-check
    command: npm run typecheck
    required: true

  - name: unit-tests
    command: npm test
    required: true
    coverage: 80%

  - name: build
    command: npm run build
    required: true
```

### Manual Gates

Gates requiring human judgment:

```markdown
## Manual Verification Checklist

Before Code Review:
- [ ] I've tested my changes locally
- [ ] I've written/updated tests
- [ ] I've read my own diff
- [ ] I've checked for security issues
- [ ] I've updated documentation

Before Deployment:
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] QA verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Stakeholder approved (if required)
- [ ] Deployment plan reviewed
```

### Conditional Gates

Gates that apply in specific situations:

| Condition | Required Gates |
|-----------|---------------|
| Security-related | Security review |
| Public API change | API review + migration plan |
| Database change | DBA review + backup plan |
| Performance-sensitive | Performance test |
| Breaking change | Deprecation notice + migration |

## Implementing Gates

### In Your Workflow

```
Task Start
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Gate: Prereqs   │ ← Verify before starting
│ - Requirements  │
│ - Dependencies  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
    Do the work
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ Gate: Completion│ ← Verify before proceeding
│ - Tests pass    │
│ - Code reviewed │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
Task Complete
```

### Gate Documentation Template

```markdown
## Gate: [Name]

**When:** [Before what action]

**Purpose:** [What this gate ensures]

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Item 1
- [ ] Item 2
- [ ] Item 3

**Verification Method:**
- [How to verify each item]

**Failure Actions:**
- [What to do if gate fails]

**Approver:** [Who can approve passage]
```

## Common Gate Failures

### "Just this once" Syndrome
- **Problem:** Skipping gates for urgent work
- **Fix:** Urgent work gets simpler gates, not no gates

### Gate Inflation
- **Problem:** Too many gates slow everything down
- **Fix:** Only gates that catch real issues

### Rubber Stamp Gates
- **Problem:** Gates passed without real verification
- **Fix:** Specific checklists, evidence requirements

## Gate Metrics

Track gate effectiveness:

```
Gate Effectiveness = Issues caught at gate / Total issues
Gate Overhead = Time spent at gates / Total development time
Gate Value = (Cost of issue caught early) / (Gate overhead cost)
```

Good gates have:
- High effectiveness (catch most issues)
- Low overhead (quick to pass)
- High value (prevent expensive fixes)

## Integration with CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
jobs:
  gate-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint

  gate-test:
    needs: gate-lint
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

  gate-build:
    needs: gate-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

  deploy:
    needs: gate-build
    # Only deploys if all gates pass
```

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Gate Before | Key Checks |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Design | Requirements | Clear, complete, approved |
| Implementation | Design | Reviewed, feasible |
| Review | Implementation | Tests, conventions, working |
| Merge | Review | Approved, conflicts resolved |
| Deploy | Merge | Environment ready, plan exists |

## Integration with Other Skills

- **design-first**: Gates validate design before implementation
- **task-decomposition**: Gates between task phases
- **testing/red-green-refactor**: Tests are key gate criteria
- **collaboration/structured-review**: Review is a gate
